## 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
----
This project is focused on predicting the future prices of stocks using historical stock data. By using machine learning and statistical models, we aim to forecast stock prices with better accuracy. The project uses datasets from real companies like Google, Microsoft, and Zomato, and implements models like Linear Regression, Moving Average, and ARIMA.

## 🧠 Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the market. This project demonstrates a practical approach using Python to explore and analyze stock data and apply models for forecasting.
---
Through this project, you will:
--
- Understand how to handle time-series data
- Visualize trends and stock behavior over time
- Implement and evaluate forecasting models
- Compare predictions with actual prices
----
## 🔍 Objective
- To analyze and visualize historical stock data
- To understand the trend and movement of stock prices
- To implement machine learning and statistical models to forecast future stock prices
- To evaluate the model performance and refine predictions
## 📊 Models Used
- 1. Linear Regression
Predicts stock prices based on linear patterns from historical data.
Useful for trend-following datasets.
- 2. Moving Average
Calculates the average of stock prices over a specific period.
Helps to smooth out short-term fluctuations and show long-term trends.
- 3. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Time-series forecasting model that considers previous values and error terms.
Suitable for datasets with trends and seasonality.

## 📈 Data Visualization
Visualization is a key part of this project:
--
- Stock price line plots over time
- Actual vs predicted price comparison
- Rolling averages (e.g., 30-day moving average)
- Visualization helps to understand the data trends before applying models.
